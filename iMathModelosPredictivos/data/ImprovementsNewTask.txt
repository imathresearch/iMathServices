It will be necessary to create a file for each service for each sector.

Now:

Telecommunications:

Working

Transport:

It is the file created, but it will be necessary to modify with the transport variables.

Dynamic Constant:

Now: Directly, each algorithm is accessing to telecommunication sector's constant.
Future: It is necessary to access to each sectors constant in each model. The necessary function
to modify is the following one:

def _readMetaDataFile(self):

	This function has static access to the telecommunication's contant and it will be necessary to 
	access to the correct sector's constant adding avariable to this function.
	
		Example: def _readMetaDataFile(self,sector):
		
			if sector=='Telecommunication':
			else:
				if sector=='Transport':
				else:
					if sector=='Banking':
